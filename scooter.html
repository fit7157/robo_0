    <h1>Why is electric-scooter so dangerous?</h1>
    <p>There were lots of cases for electric-scooter <b>accidents.</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>It overturns.</li>
        <li>It falls aside.</li>

    </ol>
    <h2>But, overturning gives the most critical impact to the driver.</h2>
   <p>If overturn happens, the driver usually hurts a lot.<br>
    Therefore, <b class="topic">I decided to discover the way to stop overturn.</b></p>
    </div>

    <div id="body">
        <h1>1. Why e-scooter is easy to overturn.</h1>
        <p>first of all I thought about why e-sooters easily go overturn compared to bicycles/<br>
        The main reason that I thought was the fact that the center of mass of the scooter is too high. 
    THe difference between bicycle and e-scooter is that people ride the scooter while they are standing.
This makes the center of mass in high position and this is why the scooter is easy to overturn. </p>

<h1>2. How can we solve it?</h1>
<p>How can we solve this problem? I thought that it is important for us to lower the center of mass.
    But if we have to ride the scooter while sitting, people will consider it uncomfotable, because 
    people want a scooter that is easy to ride. Standing is one of the key feature of e-scooter so, if we make the 
    scooter that can be operated while sitted, this will hinder the e-scooter's convenience.
    Therefore I decided that I should make the people sit only before the crash.
    This will lower the center of mass suddenly and disturb the oversturn.
</p>
<h1>3. How to prove it</h1>
<p>We are going to prove this idea by doing little experiment. 
    By using Arduino, we want to prove that this can work in the real life.

<p>This picture shows the idea. We are going to make a belt and put it to the driver.
    The belt will be connected to the motor at the rear. This motor is the key.
    The moter will operate by the information of ultra-sonic sensor. Ultra-sonic sensor recognizes the distance 
    between the scooter and outside obstalcles. If the distance is too close, and the scooter is running in fast speed,
    the scooter will consider the situation as dangerous and the moter will rotate backward. 
    This will tighten the rope that is connected to the driver. As a result, the driver will be pulled to the rear and fall behind.
    the driver will automatically fall, which makes the center of mass to be lowered. 
    As you can see, the center of mass(G) will be (G') which is lowered compared to the (G).
